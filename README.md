# 🕒 Project Submission with Auto Timestamp

A simple **OOP mini project** that automates project submissions by recording each entry with a real-time **auto timestamp**.  
Built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)** and **Java Spring Boot (Backend)**.  
The backend is **Dockerized** and deployed on **Render**, while the frontend is hosted on **GitHub Pages**.
